VN (Vanilla Traveller) [mongoose 2e]
  planet quirk occurs at 15% incidence

HS (Hard Sci-Fi)
  planets of size <= 2 and 10:
    reduce population roll by 1
  planets of atmo 5, 6 and 8:
    increase population roll by 1
    OTHERWISE reduce population roll by 1
  add population to Port Quality and subtract 7
  planet quirk occurs at 0% incidence

SO (Space Opera)
  planets of size 4 or less:
    size <= 2: atmo = 0
    atmo <= 2: atmo = 0
    atmo <= 5: atmo = 1
    atmo >= 6: atmo = 10
  planets of size 3 or 4 and atmo 10:
    reduce hydro roll by 6
  planets with atmo >= 1:
    reduce hydro roll by 6
  planets with atmo 2, 3, 11 or 12:
    reduce hydro roll by 4
  planet quirk occurs at 35% incidence
